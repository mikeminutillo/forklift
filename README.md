# Forklift

A simple ETL tool.

It allows you to define a set of shapes/structures inside a SQL server database and then pull that data out and push it into another server.

It does it using a giant SQL query so beware the effect it may have if applying it in production. It's particularly handy for moving data around between dev and test environments.
